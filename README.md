# SQL Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains a project focused on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL. The dataset used in this project (`layoffs`) tracks company layoffs, including key metrics like the total number of employees laid off, the percentage of layoffs, company funding, and more.

## Key Features of the Project:

- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Initial steps involve cleaning the dataset, standardizing fields (e.g., removing white spaces and correcting inconsistent values), and formatting date columns for further analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Detailed insights were extracted using SQL queries, exploring patterns in company layoffs by looking at metrics such as:
    - The maximum number and percentage of layoffs.
    - Companies that experienced 100% layoffs and their corresponding funding history.
    - Analysis of layoffs across different industries, countries, and years.
    - Insights into which company stages (e.g., early-stage, post-IPO) were most affected by layoffs.

- **Rolling Total Calculations**:
  - A rolling total of layoffs was computed to observe trends over time, providing insights into how layoffs evolved month by month.

- **Top 5 Companies by Year**:
  - The project also includes a query to rank the top 5 companies by total layoffs for each year.

## Summary:

This project serves as a practical application of SQL skills, including data cleaning, EDA, and window functions like rolling totals and rankings. It is designed to give a detailed look into how layoffs have impacted various industries and companies, with a particular focus on trends over recent years.

Feel free to explore the code and queries used to generate these insights!
